# LimaCharlie-EDR | Sliver C2 Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the LimaCharlie-EDR | Sliver C2 Project! This project aims to demonstrate the integration between the Sliver command and control (C2) framework and the LimaCharlie endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform for advanced adversarial simulations and detection engineering.

### Part 1

- **Setting up VMs**: Set up two VMs - Ubuntu VM as an attack machine and Windows VM as the victim machine.
- **Disabling Windows Defender**: Disabled Windows Defender on the Windows VM to avoid interference during the attack process and enable better logging and event collection.
- **Installing Sysmon**: Installed Sysmon on the Windows endpoint to gather telemetry.
- **Installing LimaCharlie EDR**: Installed and configured LimaCharlie EDR on the Windows VM to set up the Windows agent for further analysis.

#### What is LimaCharlie?

LimaCharlie is a powerful SecOps Cloud Platform featuring a cross-platform EDR agent, log shipping/ingestion capabilities, and a threat detection engine.

### Part 2

- **Generating C2 Payload**: Generated a C2 payload using Sliver-server and downloaded it into the Windows VM (victim) via a temporary Python web server.
- **Executing C2 Payload**: Executed the C2 payload on the Windows VM, enabling interaction with the C2 session.
- **Observing EDR Telemetry**: Observed EDR telemetry to identify unknown files being downloaded and analyzed their behavior.
- **Analyzing Suspected Executable**: Analyzed the suspected executable using tools like VirusTotal to determine its malicious nature.
- **Analyzing Timeline EDR Telemetry**: Analyzed Timeline EDR telemetry to understand how the malicious payload was downloaded onto the Windows agent.

### Part 3

- **Credential Theft with Sliver C2**: Used Sliver C2 for stealing credentials by dumping the lsass.exe process from memory on the victim system.
- **Creating Detection and Response Rule**: Created a Detection and Response rule in the LimaCharlie EDR for alerting on specific events related to lsass.exe.
- **Testing and Tuning Rules**: Dynamically tested and tuned the rules in the Detection and Response engine to ensure accuracy and minimize false positives before deploying them in the production environment.



# So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst - Intro

![SOC Analyst](https://blog.ecapuano.com/static/94b52c8d744c07e493dd7f7d16ef17ec/37067/soc-analyst.jpg)

Welcome to the "So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst" series! In this introductory post, we'll cover the basics of what it means to work as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst.

## What is a SOC Analyst?

A SOC Analyst is responsible for monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity incidents within an organization. They work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) and play a crucial role in maintaining the security posture of the organization.

## Key Responsibilities

### Monitoring
SOC Analysts continuously monitor security alerts and events generated by various security tools such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), and endpoint security solutions.

### Detection
They analyze incoming alerts to identify potential security incidents or anomalies. This involves correlating information from multiple sources to determine the severity and impact of the incident.

### Investigation
Once a potential security incident is identified, SOC Analysts conduct in-depth investigations to understand the root cause, scope, and extent of the incident. This may involve analyzing network traffic, system logs, and other forensic data.

### Response
SOC Analysts take appropriate actions to contain, mitigate, and remediate security incidents. This may include isolating affected systems, applying patches or updates, and coordinating with other teams for incident response.

## Skills Required

### Technical Skills
- Understanding of networking protocols and technologies
- Familiarity with security tools such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- Knowledge of operating systems (Windows, Linux) and common security threats

### Analytical Skills
- Ability to analyze and interpret large volumes of data
- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
- Capacity to think critically and make informed decisions under pressure

### Soft Skills
- Effective communication skills for documenting incidents and communicating with stakeholders
- Collaboration and teamwork for working closely with other members of the SOC and IT teams
- Adaptability and willingness to learn in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment

## Conclusion

Working as a SOC Analyst can be both challenging and rewarding. It requires a combination of technical knowledge, analytical skills, and soft skills to effectively detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. Stay tuned for upcoming posts in this series, where we'll dive deeper into the roles and responsibilities of SOC Analysts and explore various tools and techniques used in SOC operations.
